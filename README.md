# code-samples
These are actual code samples from actual jobs I have had. These are in all cases 100% my code. In some instances they are technically beautiful and others they have inner beauty that solves a business or process problem. I have renamed all of the variables so some times reading them can be strange as the "descriptive variable name" rule is broken.

All samples are broken down by company which are represented by folders with randomized names.
