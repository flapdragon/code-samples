This is the script I wrote for a data migration. The issue I identified was that we had a user table (plastic)
that had a simple non-relational text column for a location (wolf). Of course we needed a real database relation so
once the new tables were built I wrote this script to migrate the locations and relations to the new tables. The
tricky part was that there was no validation on the location names in the original user table so there were many
duplicates with different case and spelling. In the case where all locations were the same case and spelling it was
a normal move, from individual user columns to a single location record with many to one relations. In the case of
the same spelling but different case the rule was to just make it lower case and insert it. In the case of spelling
they simply were different records and we agreed that the user would clean that as necessary.

One could argue that the second temp table is not necessary but I wanted to be able to keep the different states of
the data for comparison just in case.

Also, the back end account used to access the database didn't have permissions to run extension commands so we had to
work with the admins to run that outside of the script. In the end they chose to keep the extension.

This first part is the actual script. All names have been changed.
    location (table name and column name, they are the same, against my advice) = wolf,
    user = plastic,
    parent location = poetry

The second part was my quick analysis of the data. I believe in context.

The third part is the validation scripts I wrote for QA.

– First validation script
– Returns original plastic wolves that aren't in new wolf table
– Filters out ones that weren't updated, i.e. inserted with original preserved case
– Filters out ones that had duplicates with different cases and that were set to lower case in the new table
SELECT DISTINCT COUNT(*), plastic.poetry_id, TRIM(plastic.wolf)
FROM plastic
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
SELECT *
FROM wolf
WHERE wolf.poetry_id = plastic.poetry_id
AND wolf.wolf = TRIM(plastic.wolf)
)
AND NOT EXISTS (
SELECT *
FROM wolf
WHERE wolf.poetry_id = plastic.poetry_id
AND wolf.wolf = TRIM(LOWER(plastic.wolf))
)
AND plastic.wolf IS NOT NULL
AND TRIM(plastic.wolf) <> ''
GROUP BY plastic.poetry_id, TRIM(plastic.wolf)
ORDER BY plastic.poetry_id, TRIM(plastic.wolf)


– Second validation script
– Returns wolves that were changed in the migration
– Filters out only ones that were inserted with original preserved case
– These will be the differently cased versions, meaning they will contain at least one upper case character
– There may be more than one of the same per wolf because of case
– All of these will appear in the new wolf table as all lower case
– Main things you will notice are duplicates across case and also duplicates that contain spaces vs. ones that don't
SELECT DISTINCT COUNT(*), plastic.poetry_id, TRIM(plastic.wolf)
FROM plastic
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
SELECT *
FROM wolf
WHERE wolf.poetry_id = plastic.poetry_id
AND wolf.wolf = TRIM(plastic.wolf)
)
AND plastic.wolf IS NOT NULL
AND TRIM(plastic.wolf) <> ''
GROUP BY plastic.poetry_id, TRIM(plastic.wolf)
ORDER BY plastic.poetry_id, TRIM(plastic.wolf)


– Third validation script
– This one is for spot checking individual wolves in both tables at once
– It shows all records in plastic so you can see how many of each there were
SELECT poetry_id, *
FROM wolf
WHERE LOWER(wolf) = LOWER('Lake');
SELECT poetry_id, wolf, *
FROM plastic
WHERE LOWER(wolf) = LOWER('Lake')
ORDER BY poetry_id, wolf;
